1)"redux-immutable-state-invariant": "^2.0.0"
	Rejected
	Development Dependancy. Use restricted to local.

2)"react-navigation"
	Rejected
	Release still in Beta. Alternate exists "react-router-native-flux" in the repository

3)"axios"
	Conditionally Accepted
	Native "flux" is good enough for HTTP requests. "axios" is just a wrapper which adds to the overhead.
